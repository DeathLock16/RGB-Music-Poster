# RGB Music Poster
A poster that has RGB LED strips attached on the sides, which are synchronized with music from a computer.

## Short description
    The project consists of two parts.
    The first part is a console application written in C++. By using appropriate Windows system libraries, it is possible to obtain the level of sound in percentage scale of any selected application, such as Spotify, in real-time.
    Then, the data is sent to the corresponding serial port (COM), and then transmitted via USB port to a PCB board with a suitable microprocessor (in this case, Arduino, ATMega).
    Additionally, the console application allows for horizontal visualization in case of the inability to physically test the program.
